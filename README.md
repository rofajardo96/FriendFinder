# FriendFinder

Tired of looking for that special someone? Not having any luck with apps such as Tinder, Bumble, and others?Look no further than FriendFinder. FriendFinder combines traditional personality questions and applies them to the dating world. Each new user will input their name as well as a picture of themselves that will be added to the list of users once their survey is complete and submitted. Users will then be paired with existing individuals based off the similarity of their scores.

This app uses express, bodyparser, path, javascript, html, css, and other technology in order to give the user a simple and effective way of finding the right person for them. 

In order to get this app to work on your local machine, you can copy the link to your terminal, add your own PORT or use the one provided in server.js, run node server.js within the directory, and make sure that the PORT is listening. 

After following these steps, you should now be able to run the app on your machine and begin connecting.

Finding that perfect match has never been easier.
